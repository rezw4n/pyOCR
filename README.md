# pyOCR

A simple python script that uses tesseract and pytesseract to detect texts in an image and writes it to a text file

## Requirements

pyOCR depends on two libraries, Pillow and Pytesseract. To install them simply type this following command on cmd or powershell.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note:** You need to install tesseract from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads.html) and add it to your path in order for the script to work.
